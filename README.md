**Significant Decline from 2021 Average:** For most Issue Areas, the 2021 Average column shows generally high values, but the subsequent years (2022-2025) often show a sharp drop.

**Strong Positive Outliers:** Two areas show exceptional values in a specific year:

- **3000-3500** peaks dramatically in **2023** with a value of **71.13**.

- **2000-2500** also shows a very high value in **2023** at **56.25**.

As the total subscription increases the average listing gains increases.


### YEAR WISE TREND

| Subscription Range | 2021 GAINS | 2025 GAINS | Observations |
|--------------------|------------|------------|--------------|
| **0--5x** | -3.8% | -2.7% | Under-subscribed IPOs consistently yield losses. |
| **5--10x** | 5.7% | 4.2% | Slight positive bias, but still weak. |
| **10--25x** | 10--31% | 9--23% | Reasonable steady performance range. |
| **25--75x** | 31--48% | 9--23% | Moderate erosion since the 2021 highs. |
| **100--175x** | 66--87% | 30--33% | Still strong, but half of 2021 returns. |
| **>200x** | 122.9% | 33.19% | Even high-subscription IPOs have cooled off heavily. |

</p>

- In **small-cap and mid-cap IPOs**, gains become **linear and stable after 25× subscription**, showing a clear link between demand and returns.

- **₹500--1000 Cr issues** show sharp improvement --- from ~5% at low demand to **100%+ beyond 200×**, reflecting strong retail and HNI participation.

- **Micro issues (<₹500 Cr)** maintain consistent linear growth but with **higher volatility**.

- **Large issues (>₹1500 Cr)** flatten after 50×, as institutional pricing limits upside.

- Removing outliers reduces average gains by ~4% and volatility by ~7 points, revealing a **more realistic 25--40% average return range**.

- Beyond 150×, returns become **unstable and FOMO-driven**, not fundamentally supported.

- The **sweet spot** lies in **mid-sized issues (₹0--1500 Cr)** with **25×--125× subscriptions**, yielding **40--50% average gains**.

- Overall, **market sentiment and subscription strength** drive IPO outcomes --- with steady gains post 25× and volatility beyond 150×.

### Analysis Summary

| Issue Size Range (₹ Cr) | Trend (With Outliers) | Trend (Without Outliers) | Interpretation |
|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| **0-500** | Extremely strong (avg >70×) | Still strong (avg ~60×) | Stable demand for smaller IPOs; not dependent on outliers. |
| **500-1000** | LINEAR TREND | LINEAR TREND | Less inflated after removing outliers; mid-cap strength remains. |
| **1000-1500** | Moderate to strong (~40-60×) | Moderate (~30×-40×) | Genuine investor interest; relatively stable. |
| **1500-2000** | Patchy; one or two strong listings | Drops notably | Indicates performance highly skewed by outliers. |
| **2000-3000** | Negative in some brackets | Consistently low | Weak demand for large caps; outlier removal confirms low traction. |
| **3000-4000** | One standout IPO boosts data | Falls sharply without it | Overdependence on a single successful issue. |
| **>5000** | Very poor (<0 or negative) | Remains poor | Large IPOs struggle to attract subscriptions. |

The data indicates that the **100--150, 150--200, 500--550, 550--600, 600--650, and 1000--1050** issue size ranges have delivered the highest returns, as they feature the most number of companies and the greatest cumulative gains. This suggests that the probability of achieving positive returns is significantly higher within these ranges compared to others.
