Year-Wise Sentiment and Performance

Issue Size vs Listing Gains
 
 High Volatility Across Years and Issues: There's no single, consistent trend. Performance (indicated by the values) is highly variable across different Issue Area ranges and from year to year (2022 to 2025).
Significant Decline from 2021 Average: For most Issue Areas, the 2021 Average column shows generally high values, but the subsequent years (2022-2025) often show a sharp drop.
Areas 1500-2000 and 4500-5000 show high 2021 averages (40.3 and -10.61), which then plummet in 2022 (to -1.8 and 0).
Strong Positive Outliers: Two areas show exceptional values in a specific year:
•	3000-3500 peaks dramatically in 2023 with a value of 71.13.
•	2000-2500 also shows a very high value in 2023 at 56.25$.

TOTAL SUBSCRIPTION VS LISTING GAINS



 


KEY INSIGHT 
There is positive correlation between total subscription and the listing gains 
As the total subscription increases the average listing gains increases.



YEAR WISE TREND
Subscription Range	2021 GAINS	2025 GAINS	Observations
0–5x	-3.8%	-2.7%	Under-subscribed IPOs consistently yield losses.
5–10x	5.7%	4.2%	Slight positive bias, but still weak.
10–25x	10–31%	9–23%	Reasonable steady performance range.
25–75x	31–48%	9–23%	Moderate erosion since the 2021 highs.
100–175x	66–87%	30–33%	Still strong, but half of 2021 returns.
>200x	122.9%	33.19%	Even high-subscription IPOs have cooled off heavily.


QIB Group Analysis

 

Insight
There is a positive correlation between QIB and LISTING GAIN from 0 to 300X
Beyond that, oversubscription doesn’t proportionally increase returns — indicating overvaluation effects.

DATA WITH OUTLINERS
 

DATA WITHOUT OUTLINERS
OUTLINERS ARE WHEN ONLY ONE COMPANY IN THAT RANGE 
 

•	In small-cap and mid-cap IPOs, gains become linear and stable after 25× subscription, showing a clear link between demand and returns.
•	₹500–1000 Cr issues show sharp improvement — from ~5% at low demand to 100%+ beyond 200×, reflecting strong retail and HNI participation.
•	Micro issues (<₹500 Cr) maintain consistent linear growth but with higher volatility.
•	Large issues (>₹1500 Cr) flatten after 50×, as institutional pricing limits upside.
•	Removing outliers reduces average gains by ~4% and volatility by ~7 points, revealing a more realistic 25–40% average return range.
•	Beyond 150×, returns become unstable and FOMO-driven, not fundamentally supported.
•	The sweet spot lies in mid-sized issues (₹0–1500 Cr) with 25×–125× subscriptions, yielding 40–50% average gains.
•	Overall, market sentiment and subscription strength drive IPO outcomes — with steady gains post 25× and volatility beyond 150×.

OUTLINER EFFECT IN THE ANALYSIS 

  

Issue Size Range (₹ Cr)	Trend (With Outliers)	Trend (Without Outliers)	Interpretation
0–500	Extremely strong (avg >70×)	Still strong (avg ~60×)	Stable demand for smaller IPOs; not dependent on outliers.
500–1000	LINEAR TREND 	LINEAR TREND 	Less inflated after removing outliers; mid-cap strength remains.
1000–1500	Moderate to strong (~40–60×)	Moderate (~30×–40×)	Genuine investor interest; relatively stable.
1500–2000	Patchy; one or two strong listings	Drops notably	Indicates performance highly skewed by outliers.
2000–3000	Negative in some brackets	Consistently low	Weak demand for large caps; outlier removal confirms low traction.
3000–4000	One standout IPO boosts data	Falls sharply without it	Overdependence on a single successful issue.
>5000	Very poor (<0 or negative)	Remains poor	Large IPOs struggle to attract subscriptions.


Deeper insight into issue size 
 
 
The data indicates that the 100–150, 150–200, 500–550, 550–600, 600–650, and 1000–1050 issue size ranges have delivered the highest returns, as they feature the most number of companies and the greatest cumulative gains. This suggests that the probability of achieving positive returns is significantly higher within these ranges compared to others.






Key Findings – Questions & Insights (2021–2025)
1. How did IPO performance evolve between 2021 and 2025?
The IPO market recorded 182 listings during this period, with average listing gains falling from 30.2% in 2021 to 12.1% in 2025 — a 60% contraction that reflects a shift from speculative excess to rational valuation.
2. Did investors continue to benefit despite the decline in gains?
Yes. Despite reduced premiums, 74% of IPOs still closed positively, indicating sustained investor confidence and a healthier, more disciplined market environment.
3. Which issue size categories performed the best?
Mid-sized IPOs (₹500–1500 Cr) delivered the most consistent and profitable results, averaging 26.7% gains, significantly outperforming large-cap issues (>₹3000 Cr) that averaged only 4.8%.
4. What role did institutional investors (QIBs) play in performance?
QIB participation had a strong positive correlation up to 300× subscription, beyond which the benefit plateaued, signalling that oversubscription beyond this point leads to overvaluation rather than higher returns.
5. Where does the optimal opportunity lie for investors?
The ideal range lies in ₹100–1500 Cr issue sizes with 25×–125× subscription levels, which historically yielded 40–50% average listing gains — combining strong demand with manageable risk.
6. What is the overall outlook for the Indian IPO ecosystem?
The data confirms that the IPO market is now structurally stable and fundamentals-driven, transitioning from hype cycles to sustainable, long-term value creation beyond FY2025.
