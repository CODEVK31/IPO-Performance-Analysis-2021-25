## Issue Size vs Listing Gains

![Issue Size vs Listing Gains](images/Screenshot%202025-11-08%20014558.png)

### Key Observations

**High Volatility Across Years and Issues:** There's no single, consistent trend. Performance is highly variable across different Issue Area ranges and from year to year (2022 to 2025).

**Significant Decline from 2021 Average:** For most Issue Areas, the 2021 Average column shows generally high values, but the subsequent years (2022-2025) often show a sharp drop.

- Areas **1500-2000** and **4500-5000** show high 2021 averages (40.3 and -10.61), which then plummet in 2022 (to -1.8 and 0).

**Strong Positive Outliers:** Two areas show exceptional values in a specific year:
- **3000-3500** peaks dramatically in **2023** with a value of **71.13**.
- **2000-2500** also shows a very high value in **2023** at **56.25**.

## Total Subscription vs Listing Gains

![Total Subscription vs Listing Gains](images/Screenshot%202025-11-08%20184203.png)

### KEY INSIGHT

There is a **positive correlation** between **total subscription** and the **listing gains**.

As the total subscription increases, the average listing gains increase.

### Year-Wise Trend

| Subscription Range | 2021 GAINS | 2025 GAINS | Observations |
|-------------------|------------|------------|--------------|
| **0-5x** | -3.8% | -2.7% | Under-subscribed IPOs consistently yield losses. |
| **5-10x** | 5.7% | 4.2% | Slight positive bias, but still weak. |
| **10-25x** | 10-31% | 9-23% | Reasonable steady performance range. |
| **25-75x** | 31-48% | 9-23% | Moderate erosion since the 2021 highs. |
| **100-175x** | 66-87% | 30-33% | Still strong, but half of 2021 returns. |
| **>200x** | 122.9% | 33.19% | Even high-subscription IPOs have cooled off heavily. |

## QIB Group Analysis

![QIB Analysis](images/Screenshot%202025-11-08%20184241.png)

### Insight

There is **a positive correlation** between QIB and LISTING GAIN from 0 to 300X.

Beyond that, oversubscription doesn't proportionally increase returns — indicating overvaluation effects.

## Issue Size vs Subscription Level Performance

### Data WITH Outliers

![Data with Outliers](images/Screenshot%202025-11-08%20184256.png)

### Data WITHOUT Outliers

**Note:** Outliers are when only one company exists in that range.

![Data without Outliers](images/Screenshot%202025-11-08%20184317.png)

### Key Findings

- In **small-cap and mid-cap IPOs**, gains become **linear and stable after 25× subscription**, showing a clear link between demand and returns.

- **₹500-1000 Cr issues** show sharp improvement — from ~5% at low demand to **100%+ beyond 200×**, reflecting strong retail and HNI participation.

- **Micro issues (<₹500 Cr)** maintain consistent linear growth but with **higher volatility**.

- **Large issues (>₹1500 Cr)** flatten after 50×, as institutional pricing limits upside.

- Removing outliers reduces average gains by ~4% and volatility by ~7 points, revealing a **more realistic 25-40% average return range**.

- Beyond 150×, returns become **unstable and FOMO-driven**, not fundamentally supported.

- The **sweet spot** lies in **mid-sized issues (₹0-1500 Cr)** with **25×-125× subscriptions**, yielding **40-50% average gains**.

- Overall, **market sentiment and subscription strength** drive IPO outcomes — with steady gains post 25× and volatility beyond 150×.

## Outlier Effect in the Analysis

| Issue Size Range (₹ Cr) | Trend (With Outliers) | Trend (Without Outliers) | Interpretation |
|-------------------------|----------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| **0-500** | Extremely strong (avg >70×) | Still strong (avg ~60×) | Stable demand for smaller IPOs; not dependent on outliers. |
| **500-1000** | LINEAR TREND | LINEAR TREND | Less inflated after removing outliers; mid-cap strength remains. |
| **1000-1500** | Moderate to strong (~40-60×) | Moderate (~30×-40×) | Genuine investor interest; relatively stable. |
| **1500-2000** | Patchy; one or two strong listings | Drops notably | Indicates performance highly skewed by outliers. |
| **2000-3000** | Negative in some brackets | Consistently low | Weak demand for large caps; outlier removal confirms low traction. |
| **3000-4000** | One standout IPO boosts data | Falls sharply without it | Overdependence on a single successful issue. |
| **>5000** | Very poor (<0 or negative) | Remains poor | Large IPOs struggle to attract subscriptions. |

## Deeper Insight into Issue Size

![Issue Size Analysis Table](images/Screenshot%202025-11-08%20184441.png)

### Optimal Issue Size Ranges

The data indicates that the **100-150, 150-200, 500-550, 550-600, 600-650, and 1000-1050** issue size ranges have delivered the highest returns, as they feature the most number of companies and the greatest cumulative gains. 

This suggests that the probability of achieving positive returns is significantly higher within these ranges compared to others.

## Key Takeaways and Investment Recommendations

### Sweet Spot for IPO Investments

1. **Optimal Issue Size**: ₹100-200 Cr and ₹500-1050 Cr ranges show the highest probability of positive returns

2. **Subscription Levels**: Target IPOs with 25×-125× subscription for optimal risk-reward balance

3. **QIB Participation**: Strong QIB subscription (up to 300×) indicates institutional confidence and better listing gains

4. **Market Timing**: 
   - 2021 represented peak euphoria with unsustainable returns
   - 2022 was a correction phase with negative sentiment
   - 2023-2024 showed recovery with balanced returns
   - 2025 indicates market maturity with rational pricing

### Risk Factors to Consider

- **Under-subscribed IPOs (0-5×)**: Consistently yield losses; avoid unless fundamentally strong
- **Over-subscribed beyond 150×**: Returns become FOMO-driven and unstable
- **Large-cap issues (>₹5000 Cr)**: Struggle with subscription and listing gains
- **Single outlier dependence**: Some size ranges show inflated performance due to one successful IPO

### Strategic Approach

- Focus on mid-sized issues (₹0-1500 Cr) with moderate to strong subscription (25×-125×)
- Monitor QIB participation as a leading indicator of institutional confidence
- Avoid extremes: both under-subscribed and excessively over-subscribed IPOs
- Diversify across multiple issue size ranges within the optimal zones
- Consider market cycle timing for entry and exit strategies
